## Shitbox

Shitbox is a nodejs server that needs to run on a Windows host and send messages to another Windows computer.

To set up, clone the repo and open it in CMD. Make sure you have NodeJS installed.
Then, modify the config file and add the IPs of your computers and edit the branding if you want.
Install dependencies with
```
npm install
```
then run with
```
npm serve
```
You can also use the included batch script (launch.bat) or launchl.bat for legacy Windows versions.
